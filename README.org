This project is still being developed. I promise nothing. 

This package is now split into two separate packages: =org-dynamic-bullets= which handles the dynamic bullets, and =org-visual-indent= which adds vertical lines to =org-indent=. They can be used independently. 

To get the above effect, clone the repository, put it in your load path and:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (require 'org-dynamic-bullets)
  (require 'org-visual-indent)
  (org-dynamic-bullets-mode)
  (org-visual-indent-mode)
#+end_src

=org-dynamic-bullets= does not provide any indentation or way to discern the level of a heading (i.e., it replaces all leading stars with a single bullet and without indentation). If you don't like the vertical lines shown above, use it with vanilla =org-indent-mode=. 

There are two faces you’ll want to set if you use =org-visual-indent=: =org-visual-indent-pipe-face= and =org-visual-indent-blank-pipe-face=. The foreground and background color of =org-visual-indent-blank-pipe-face= should match your background. The foreground and background color of =org-visual-indent-pipe-face= should both be the desired color of the vertical line. By default, these colors are set based on the =default= face, which may or may not match the theme you are using if the the package is loaded before your theme is set. 

[2021-02-02 Tue] New feature – custom colors for vertical lines
The following code allows the user to define the color of the vertical bars:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (setq org-visual-indent-color-indent '((1 . "blue")
                                         (2 . "red")
                                         (3 . "green")))
#+end_src
[[./vertical-bar-color-screenshot.png]]
The colors will cycle through to the beginning of the list once the max depth is reached. This overrides the color set by 
=org-visual-indent-pipe-face=. It also enforces a default height of .1 for the pipe face.


Please open issues for any bugs. I am still testing this and feedback is welcome.
