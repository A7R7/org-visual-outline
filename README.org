This package is now split into two separate packages: =org-dynamic-bullets= which handles the dynamic bullets, and =org-visual-indent= which adds vertical lines to =org-indent=. They can be used independently. 

To get the above effect, clone the repository, put it in your load path and:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (require 'org-dynamic-bullets)
  (require 'org-visual-indent)
  (org-dynamic-bullets-mode)
  (org-visual-indent-mode)
#+end_src

=org-dynamic-bullets= does not provide any indentation or way to discern the level of a heading (i.e., it replaces all leading stars with a single bullet and without indentation). If you don't like the vertical lines shown above, use it with vanilla =org-indent-mode=.
